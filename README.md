# HighFrequencyEmergencyDepartmentML
Predicting high frequency users of an emergency department using the MIMIC-III clinical dataset. 


## In construction 

## Project Description 
Noteworthy are the small subset of patients, commonly referred to as high-frequency users, who make up only 4.5-8% of all ED patients, yet account for a staggering 21-30% of visits (LaCalle & Rabin, 2010). High-frequency users are known to have higher rates of mortality, hospital admissions, and outpatient visits compared to their non-frequent counterparts (Moe et al., 2016). This population significantly contributes to ED overcrowding, disproportionate resource utilization, and are affected by adverse outcomes (Hunt et al., 2006; Moe et al., 2016). Therefore, interventions aimed at this group could potentially decrease ED visits and improve outcomes from an individual patient and health system perspective.


The ultimate aim was to leverage the predictive capability of machine learning models and explainability of these models to facilitate early decision-making and disposition planning for high-frequency ED users. By identifying these individuals early and implementing proactive interventions, we hope to reduce ED visits, improve care quality, and enhance ED metrics. Understanding the characteristics of frequent ED users is fundamental to decreasing ED overcrowding and assisting these patients.
